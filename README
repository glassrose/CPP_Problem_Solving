This is a collection of efficient solutions to random and ad-hoc algorithmic problems in C++ composed by Chandni Verma.

This project is done by me at free time and none of the codes are influenced by or related to my employer in any way.
The problems I solve here are picked up by various online algorithmic programming portals and the solutions are based on traditional data structures and classical algorithms and possibly some elementary or advanced Maths.

As such this material is meant for reference and is recommended that if you are solving a similar problem then try to solve it yourself first. If you cannot solve it after some attempts then go through the solution presented here and try to code it in your own words using your language of preference.
